# Automating lending, staking and farming through manual rules(exampale to settings)
1. Cross-protocol lending
- Rules for loans/deposits:
  - If APY on AAVE for USDC > 8% → deposit 100k USDC
  - If the price of ETH falls below $2000 → repay 30% of the USDC loan to Compound
- Auto-rebalancing of collateral:
  - Dynamically change the LTV (Loan-to-Value) on platforms (e.g., reduce liquidation risk in volatility).
2. Liquidity management
- Auto-farming in pools (Uniswap, Curve)
  - Rules for adding/removing liquidity:
    If APR in ETH/USDC pool < 15% → withdraw 50% liquidity
  - Automatic collection of rewards (harvest) on schedule (every 24 hours).
- Impermanent Loss Protection
  - Closing a position if the price difference between the assets in the pool exceeds a specified % (e.g. 20%).
3. Trigger stake
- Automatic Staking/Unstaking:
  - If ETH staking rewards in Lido > $500 per day → add another 100 ETH
  - If blockchain network uptime < 99% → take the stake out of the node
4. Arbitration between protocols
- Manual conditions for the transfer of funds
  - If USDT loan rate on AAVE is 2% lower than on Compound → borrow on AAVE, deposit on Compound
