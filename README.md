## üöÄ **Key Features**  

### üîí Dynamic Risk Management
- Tracks portfolio peak value and calculates drawdown in real time.
- When drawdown exceeds a configurable maximum, automatically hedges exposure (e.g., converts BTC to USDT or opens offsetting futures). 
- Disables further trading until manual reset or recovery. 

### üíπ Portfolio Tracking & Hedging
- Aggregates balances and calculates total portfolio value across all venues. 
- Executes hedges proportionally across exchanges and chains.

### üìä Exchange & DEX Connectivity
- Integrates with multiple centralized exchanges (CEX) via CCXT.
- Connects to decentralized exchanges (DEX) on various chains via on-chain APIs or SDKs (e.g., Web3.py, 0x).
- Unified interface for fetching prices, balances, and placing orders across CEX and DEX.

### ‚òÑÔ∏è Cross-Chain Arbitrage
- Monitors price spreads of BTC/USDT across configured exchanges and networks.
- Executes buy on the lowest-priced venue and sell on the highest when the spread exceeds a threshold.  
- Supports bridging assets across chains to capture cross-chain opportunities.
- Automatically cancels or halts trades based on risk conditions.

### üåê Leveraged Long/Short Trading
- Opens margin or futures positions to go long or short on BTC. 
- Configurable leverage levels per exchange or trading pair.
- Integrates risk checks to prevent liquidation and excessive exposure.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è TWAP Execution
- Splits large orders into multiple slices over time to minimize market impact.
- Configurable number of slices and interval between each slice.
- Pauses or cancels remaining slices if risk thresholds are breached.

### üìë Unified Logging & Alerts
- Standardized log output for all actions (trades, hedges, risk events).
- Timestamped entries with log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) for audit and debugging.
- Optional email or webhook alerts on critical events.

### üîç Scheduler Loop
- Uses a simple scheduler (schedule library) to run strategies at defined intervals.
- Continuous loop with configurable polling frequencies.
