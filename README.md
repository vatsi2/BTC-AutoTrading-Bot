## üåü Main Features

- Multi-Chain Mixing: Mix BTC, ETH, XMR, ZEC, and more via integrated blockchains.
- DAO Storage:	Store funds in zero-knowledge DAOs (Aztec, Tornado Cash, Secret Network).
- Auto Wallet Generation:	Create 5+ one-time wallets per session (HD seeds, encrypted in RAM).
- DEX Routing:	Swap assets via THORChain, Haveno, SecretSwap, and Uniswap.
- Tor/I2P Integration:	All traffic routed through Tor nodes or I2P for IP anonymity.
- Decoy Transactions:	5‚Äì10% of funds sent to random addresses to obfuscate tracing.

## üîß Operating Principle
Step 1: Input Phase

     1. Local Setup:

        - Install CCA on an air-gapped device (recommended: Tails OS).

        - Connect wallet with DAO (MetaMask/TrustWallet/Another) or import a temporary seed phrase.

     2. Network Isolation:

        - Traffic forced through Tor. Node connections use .onion endpoints.

Step 2: Deposit & Mixing

    1. Fragmentation:

        - Funds split into randomized amounts (e.g., 1 BTC ‚Üí 0.3 + 0.45 + 0.25 BTC).

    2. Cross-Chain Swaps:

        - Use DEXs (THORChain) to convert fragments to privacy coins (XMR, ZEC).

    3. DAO Pooling:

        - Deposit mixed funds into a zk-SNARKs DAO (e.g., Aztec) for anonymized storage.

Step 3: Distribution

    1. Output Wallets:

        - CCA generates 5+ wallets (Bitcoin Taproot, Monero stealth addresses, etc.).

    2. Randomized Routing:

        - Funds exit DAO via unique paths (e.g., DAO ‚Üí XMR ‚Üí BTC ‚Üí ETH).

    3. Time Delays:

        - Transactions sent with random delays (1 hour to 7 days) to prevent timing analysis.

Step 4: Cleanup

    - RAM Wipe: Overwrite memory to erase keys, seeds, and transaction logs.

    - Decoy Traces: Generate fake transactions to mask real activity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Conditions & Requirements

- OS Support: Linux (Tails/Whonix recommended), Windows, macOS.
- Hardware: 8+ GB RAM, 100 GB storage (for blockchain nodes), x64/ARM CPUs.
- Blockchain Nodes: Local nodes for Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum (synced via Tor).
- Legal Compliance: Users must comply with local regulations. CCA is a privacy research tool.
